- Ridge and Lasso Regression models were used to predict the price of the houses and around **91%** of the prices were predicted accurately.
- An RMSE ( Root Mean Squared Error) of **0.114** was observed which is pretty low. 
- Hyperparameter tuning was also done for the models to achieve the best possible outcome.
